# Welcome to my first repository on github

Hello my name is Joseph Rivera, I have major interest in the web-development field. It all started on <a href="https://www.udemy.com/">Udemy</a>. I took <a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/learn/v4/overview">The Web Developer Bootcamp</a> by Colt Steele that led me to learn about <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference">HTML5</a>
, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference">CSS3</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript">Javascript</a>, <a href="http://code.jquery.com/">jQuery</a>, <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/about/">NodeJS</a>,	<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20435653/what-is-vanillajs">VanillaJS</a>
and much more. I also took many other courses that taught me about how to program in <a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/guide">AngularJS</a>, 	<a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>, 	<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/">C#</a>, and 	<a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/index.htm">C++</a>. Along with a course on building AI, and developing games with the <a href="https://unity3d.com/">Unity</a> engine.


### The Break Down
For the past few years I've worked as a valet, and some how found my way behind a bar. What I've learned from those small jobs are that I hate bartending and will never be able to pay my bills as a valet. I sought out that I needed an escape from these jobs and going to college wasn't an option in my case. Unfortunatly unable to afford to go to school the "old fashioned" way I decided to find an alternative to learn a skill that would potentially put me in a career that I would enjoy. Thats where <a href="https://www.udemy.com/">Udemy</a> came in. Inspired by a video on facebook I went to the site and ventured on into finding different courses in the web development field.
